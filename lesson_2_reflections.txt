What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git file is created. This file is the metadata file of the repository, keep track of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It holds what will be committed to the repository and not files in the working directory not slated for the repository. It allows you to see and double check what files will be committed.
