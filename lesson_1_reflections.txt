How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Focused on only the changes so could find the bug faster without going through all the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Can compare any and all versions to another.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
So interrelated changes can be tracked together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log to get the commit id's and diff to see the differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You know you can revert back to a former commit to make finding the bug faster and easier.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Storing, and keeping track of all versions of code I write.
